Local authorities have a duty to compile and report data for statutory returns to DfE and  Ofsted. Systems capture and enable the extraction of data within the relevant statutory framework. Local authorities will also want to collect data for their local service needs that is additional to the statutory data collection for activities such as performance monitoring and forecasting. 

The amount of data and the method through which it is collected needs to be considered from both the perspective of those inputting the data and those who need to work with the data. 

Problems can occur if data entry is time consuming. Poor quality and untimely data can also cause issues when planning services and delivering the right support to families and children. 

Local authorities must consider their duties under the Children Act 1989. Guidance is also available in Working together to safeguard children.
