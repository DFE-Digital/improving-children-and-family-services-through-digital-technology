title: "Accessibility"
---

Systems and tools must be accessible to meet the needs of a diverse range of users. This should take into account their locations and different needs, such as physical, cultural or learning needs.

They must:

* be easy to use and understand
* meet accessibility standards for both online and offline elements
* not exclude any users they are intended to serve

Local authorities have a legal duty to meet web content accessibility standards.

Suppliers and local authorities should:

* do research with potential users for the service with a range of accessibility needs
* make sure people are not excluded from using the system because they lack digital skills or internet access
* deliver appropriate training and support where necessary
* gather evidence of user feedback on the accessibility and inclusivity of systems
* release updates to continually improve the accessibility of the system
