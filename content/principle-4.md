## Understanding system options

You should explore what options are available. Speak to other local authorities who have implemented new systems or developed their system. 

Identify what is suitable for your circumstances and will allow for future growth and development. 

You should consider:

* whether the system will give you a suitable foundation that you can build upon
* if users can use the system in an optimised way
* if extra support is needed 
* whether there are complexities that might be an  issue for users
* if you can take on another system or  have plans in place to make things simpler
* whether you’ve got resources to make things simpler
* how you can optimise what you already have
* how to ensure no loss of knowledge when staff leave

You should think about how the wider context, such as behavioural or cultural factors, will support or potentially detract from delivering a system that meets user and service needs. 

For example:

* cultural barriers to information sharing
* lack of workforce confidence in using new digital technology

Speak to other local authorities who have implemented new systems or developed their system, this could be done as part of a pre-market engagement exercise or something which you you look to do ahead of developing an existing system.

## Understanding statutory requirements

Local authorities have a duty to compile and report data for statutory returns to DfE and Ofsted. Systems capture and enable the extraction of data within the relevant statutory framework. Local authorities will also want to collect data for their local service needs that is additional to the statutory data collection for activities such as performance monitoring and forecasting.

The amount of data and the method through which it is collected needs to be considered from both the perspective of those inputting the data and those who need to work with the data.

Problems can occur if data entry is time consuming. Poor quality and untimely data can also cause issues when planning services and delivering the right support to families and children.

Local authorities must consider their duties under the [Children Act 1989](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/contents). Guidance is also available in [Working together to safeguard children](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/working-together-to-safeguard-children--2).

Local authorities have a legal duty to protect the information they record, hold and share about vulnerable children. 

Suppliers and developers should demonstrate how:

* the system meets the required standards and complies with [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/)
* data can be accessed and shared across organisations
* management can deny or permit access without needing assistance from support teams
* alerts are managed when access is attempted without permission

You should also follow the guidance set out in [Information sharing advice for safeguarding practitioners](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-practitioners-information-sharing-advice).

Local authorities should:

* identify security and privacy threats to the service
* have a plan and budget to manage security 
* collect and process personal information in a way that’s secure 
* work with business and information risk teams, for example, senior information risk owners, to make sure the service meets security requirements without putting delivery at risk
* carry out appropriate vulnerability and penetration testing
