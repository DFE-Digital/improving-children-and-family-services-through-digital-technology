title: "Information sharing"
---

Local authorities have a legal duty to protect the information they record, hold and share about vulnerable children. 

Suppliers and developers should demonstrate how:

* the system meets the required standards and complies with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
* data can be accessed and shared across organisations
* management can deny or permit access without needing assistance from support teams
* alerts are managed when access is attempted without permission

You should also follow the guidance set out in Information sharing advice for safeguarding practitioners.

Local authorities should:

* identify security and privacy threats to the service
* have a plan and budget to manage security 
* collect and process personal information in a way thatâ€™s secure 
* work with business and information risk teams, for example, senior information risk owners, to make sure the service meets security requirements without putting delivery at risk
carry out appropriate vulnerability and penetration testing

Detailed guidance is available at NHS Data Security and Protection Toolkit.
