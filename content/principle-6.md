title: "Research the options"
---

You should explore what options are available. Speak to other local authorities who have implemented new systems or developed their system. 

Identify what is suitable for your circumstances and will allow for future growth and development. 

You should consider:

* whether the system will give you a suitable foundation that you can build upon
* if users can use the system in an optimised way
* if extra support is needed 
* whether there are complexities that might be an  issue for users
* if you can take on another system or  have plans in place to make things simpler
* whether youâ€™ve got resources to make things simpler
* how you can optimise what you already have
* how to ensure no loss of knowledge when staff leave

You should think about how the wider context, such as behavioural or cultural factors, will support or potentially detract from delivering a system that meets user and service needs. 

For example:

* cultural barriers to information sharing
* lack of workforce confidence in using new digital technology
