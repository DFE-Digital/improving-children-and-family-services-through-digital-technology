title: "Design systems that include performance analytics for monitoring"

##Importance of data and oversight

Data must be used to inform decision-making at all levels (from frontline workers, to strategic planners) and across the safeguarding partnership.

Analytics should be built-in and easy to read. Performance data and analytics should be made available to improve policy development and transparency.

Systems should collect data that meets statutory guidance and monitors performance, and make it accessible to users.

Data can be used more effectively by improving technology, infrastructure, and processes.

Information should be made available for decision-making as close to real-time as possible. 

##Available guidance

* [Read Make better use of data](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-better-use-of-data)
* [Read point 10 of the GDS Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-10-define-success-publish-performance-data)

##Good practice

During procurement, the following should be demonstrated:

* how the system provides appropriate controlled access to the data through reports and data warehouse
* how it can run reports directly from the system
* how it can connect to data warehouse and other products such as PowerBI (if needed)
* how it allows managers to run reports through a suite of self-service report building tools which can be used at any time
* that the reporting tool is not process intensive

##Challenges 

Elements that can help (data type flags in the coding and retention) are not always robust or flexible enough to meet expectations. Similar organisations can interpret the same information in different ways. All data requires context or it can lead to misunderstandings.
