##Importance of data and oversight

Data should be used to inform decision-making at all levels (from frontline workers, to strategic planners) and across the safeguarding partnership.

Systems should collect data that meets statutory guidance and monitors performance, and makes it accessible to users.

Data can be used more effectively by improving technology, infrastructure, and processes.

Analytics should be built-in and easy to read. Performance data and analytics should be made available to improve policy development and transparency.

Information should be made available for decision-making as close to real-time as possible. 

##Available guidance

* [Make better use of data](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-better-use-of-data)
* [Point 10 of the GDS Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-10-define-success-publish-performance-data)

##Good practice

During procurement, the following should be demonstrated:

* how the system provides appropriate controlled access to the data through reports and data warehouse
* how it can run reports directly from the system
* how it can connect to data warehouse and other products such as PowerBI (if needed)
* how it allows managers to run reports through a suite of self-service report building tools which can be used at any time
* that the reporting tool is not process intensive
