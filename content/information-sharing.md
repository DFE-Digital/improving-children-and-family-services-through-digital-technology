title: "Information sharing"
---

Local authorities should have a strategy and documented approach to information sharing. There should be a clear understanding of what information needs to be shared, for what purpose and who needs access to it. This should be understood to find appropriate solutions based on existing systems and capabilities. 

Inadequate sharing of information within organisations and across agencies can pose significant safeguarding risks and make it harder to join up children and family services.  

When developing or purchasing new systems you should consider:

* how the product can link with early help, virtual school, education, health systems and other existing systems, including across multi-agency partnerships 
* how it can link with future systems local authorities might adopt
* how it meets open API standards
* examples of collaboration or integration
* the appropriate and secure transfer of information between systems
* how the system will support local authorities to meet [data protection regulations](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/)

%You should also follow the guidance set out in [Information sharing advice for safeguarding practitioners](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-practitioners-information-sharing-advice).%

## Data recording

The amount of data and the method through which it is collected needs to be considered from both the perspective of those inputting the data and those who need to work with the data.

Suppliers and developers should demonstrate how:

* the system meets the required standards and complies with [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/)
* data can be accessed and shared across organisations
* management can deny or permit access without needing assistance from support teams
* alerts are managed when access is attempted without permission

^Detailed guidance is available at [NHS Data Security and Protection Toolkit](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/our-work/nhs-digital-data-and-technology-standards/framework/beta---data-security-standards).^

Local authorities should:

* identify security and privacy threats to the service
* have a plan and budget to manage security 
* collect and process personal information in a way that’s secure 
* work with business and information risk teams, for example, senior information risk owners, to make sure the service meets security requirements without putting delivery at risk
* carry out appropriate vulnerability and penetration testing

## Supporting interoperability

Safeguarding and supporting vulnerable children requires many organisations to work together. Information needs to be shared between local authorities and other partners such as:

* the police
* health services
* schools or colleges

Interoperability is needed to ensure systems within local authorities can be joined-up and enable the smooth and secure flow of information. It also means local authorities can integrate their systems with applications from a range of suppliers to best meet their service needs.

Applications, data and processes must work together to make the right information available to the right user at the right time.

### Benefits of interoperability

Interoperability supports:

* the exchange and sharing of information between different systems to allow communication across local authorities and other organisations
* quick, efficient, appropriate and safe sharing of child and family data
* the integration of third-party applications   

### Using open application programming interfaces (APIs)

Application programming interfaces (APIs) allow 2 applications to communicate with one another to access data.

Having functionality available through an API ensures organisations can integrate systems and deliver the best systems to suit their needs. 

Some local authorities may already have systems providing ‘end to end’ functionality that do not require extra integration work. This is an acceptable approach, however it can limit options and flexibility in the future. Ensuring systems have open APIs means you have flexibility and control, both technically and commercially.

Sharing data between different systems, with appropriate controls in place, makes it easier for social care workers to ensure information is used to improve child safety and wellbeing. It also allows for add-on products and services to be purchased and integrated with third-party supplier's products. APIs often allow this to be done quicker and at a lower cost than other methods.
