title: "Information sharing"
---

You should share information to joined-up multi-agency family and children services for safeguarding purposes, you also need to ensure you do this in a way that complies with information and data sharing requirements.

You should have a strategy and documented approach to information sharing. There should be a clear understanding of what information needs to be shared, for what purpose, whether the sharing is lawful, who needs access to it, and the associated risks. This will help you to find appropriate solutions based on existing systems and capabilities.

Inadequate sharing of information within organisations and across agencies can pose significant safeguarding risks and make it harder to join up children and family services.

When thinking about developing or purchasing new systems you should consider:

* how the product can link with early help, virtual school, education, health systems and other existing systems, including across multi-agency partnerships
* how the product can link with future systems local authorities might adopt
* how the product meets open application programming interfaces (API) standards
* examples of collaboration or integration
* the appropriate and secure transfer of information between systems
* how the system will support local authorities to meet data protection regulations (https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/dp-at-the-end-of-the-transition-period/data-protection-and-the-eu-in-detail/the-uk-gdpr/)

You should also follow the guidance set out in [Information sharing advice for safeguarding practitioners](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safeguarding-practitioners-information-sharing-advice) and the [Data Sharing: A Code of Practice](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/ico-codes-of-practice/data-sharing-code/).

### Data recording

You should record and share data with a clear purpose to provide data for decision-making, planning and oversight at all levels of the system, without data collection getting in the way of frontline delivery. 

The amount of data and the method through which it is collected needs to be considered from both the perspective of those inputting the data and those who need to work with the data.

You should know how:

* the system meets the required standards and complies with UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018
* data can be accessed and shared across organisations
* management can deny or permit access without needing assistance from support teams
* alerts are managed when access is attempted without permission
* where the system may be vulnerable to cyber attacks

Local authorities should:

* identify security and privacy risks and threats to the service
* have a plan and budget to manage security and ensure that these have visibility and oversight at the highest level
* collect and process personal information in a way that’s secure
* work with business and information risk teams, for example, senior information risk owners, to make sure the service meets security requirements without putting delivery at risk
* carry out appropriate vulnerability and penetration testing 

%Local authorities must ensure any systems meet [data protection regulation standards, guidance is available from the Information Comissioner's Office (ICO)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/).

There is (guidance available from the Information Comissioner’s Office (ICO)[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps] and various organisations including NHS digital and the National Care Association have toolkits available. 

### Supporting interoperability

Safeguarding and supporting vulnerable children requires many organisations to work together. Information may need  to be shared between  local authorities and other safeguarding partners such as:

* the police
* health services
* schools or colleges

Interoperability is needed to ensure systems within local authorities can be joined up and enables the smooth and secure flow of information. It also means local authorities can integrate their systems with applications from a range of suppliers to best meet their service needs.

Applications, data and processes should work together to make the right information available to the right user at the right time.

#### Benefits of interoperability

Interoperability supports:

* the exchange and sharing of information between different systems to allow communication across local authorities and other organisations
* quick, efficient, appropriate and safe sharing of child and family data
* the integration of third-party applications

### Using open application programming interfaces (APIs)

APIs allow 2 applications to communicate with one another to access data.Using APIs means organisations can integrate systems.

Some local authorities may already have systems providing ‘end to end’ functionality that do not require extra integration work. This is an acceptable approach, but it can limit  flexibility in the future. Ensuring systems have open APIs means you have flexibility and control, both technically and commercially.

Sharing data between different systems, with appropriate controls in place, makes it easier for social care workers to ensure information is used to improve child safety and wellbeing. It also allows for add-on products and services to be purchased and integrated with third-party supplier products. APIs often allow this to be done quicker more cheaply than other methods.

There is government guidance on [Open standards for government data and technology](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/open-standards-for-government-data-and-technology#recommended-open-standards) and [Describing RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-open-standards-for-government/describing-restful-apis-with-openapi-3).
