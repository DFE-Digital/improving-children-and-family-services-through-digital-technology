title: Improving children and family services through digital technology
---

## Introduction

This guidance is to help local authorities consider how they can develop the digital systems they use to manage their children's social care services. These systems often interact and support wider children and family services, therefore this guidance may also apply more widely. 

It aims to help you consider how systems:

* support the recording, tracking and analysis of children’s and families’ records 
* are procured, set up and managed
* interact with other systems to share information and link services together
* can be monitored and measured to identify opportunities for improvement

Systems need to meet a number of complex needs that may sometimes conflict, such as:

* meeting the needs of people who use the system - based on research with them
* data input, transfer and output needs
* efficiency, quality and value for money
* monitoring the service and performance reporting
* meeting legal duties to report and share information

Whilst the use of digital systems can create efficiencies and better oversight, they can only work well when developed with and embedded into best practice to support frontline delivery of children's social care. 

## Delivering your vision

Digital systems and tools should support your children’s social care service to deliver its vision and goals. 

Whether they are purchased or developed in-house, they need to be designed, implemented and managed based on the needs of your individual children's service, its partners and your users.  

To make the best use of digital systems and technology, you need to:

* identify the services vision and goals
* carry out an assessment of how existing systems are used and how users interact with them
* identify barriers and ways digital services can better meet user needs to support the service 
* make a problem statement that details your desired outcomes

You should also do an assessment of your digital maturity and make an individual improvement plan that aligns with your local authorities' overarching vision and goals.

## Considerations

Consider how the system will:

* help frontline users to meet the needs of children and families
* take account of users’ individual needs, including different locations, digital skills and accessibility requirements
* help empower children and families 
* support joined-up multi-agency family and safeguarding services
* provide data for decision-making, planning and oversight at all levels of the system, without data collection getting in the way of frontline delivery 
* comply with information sharing and data requirements 
* be compatible with existing processes, data, systems, technology and tools
* be deliverable within budget and resource planning limits
* be flexible in response to changing needs and requirements 

This is not an exhaustive list. You should understand how your service has developed over time, your existing infrastructure and have a clear vision of what you want your service to achieve before seeking any solution or development.
