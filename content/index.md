title: Local authority guidance for children’s social care case management systems
---

## Introduction

This guidance is to help local authorities improve the digital systems they use to manage their children's social care services. These systems are often part of wider children and family services, so you may find this guidance useful to other services in your local authority. 

The guidance will help you consider how systems:

* can support the recording, tracking and analysis of children’s and families’ records
* are procured, set up and managed
* interact with other systems to share information and link services together
* can be monitored and measured to identify opportunities for improvement

Systems need to meet a number of complex needs that can potentially conflict, such as:

* the needs of people who use the system (based on research with them)
* meeting data input, transfer and output needs
* delivering efficiency, quality and value for money
* monitoring the service and performance reporting
* meeting legal duties to report and share information

Systems also need to be deliverable within budget and resource planning limits and be flexible in response to changing needs and requirements
Whilst digital technology and the use of digital systems can create efficiencies and better oversight, they can only work well when developed with staff and service users and embedded into your ways of working.

### Delivering your vision

Systems, whether purchased or developed in-house, should  be designed, implemented and managed based on the needs of your individual children’s service, its partners and your users.

To make the best use of digital systems and technology, you should:

* identify the service’s vision and goals
* assess how existing systems are used
* understand how users interact with existing systems
* identify barriers and ways digital services can better meet user needs
* make a problem statement that details your desired outcomes

You should also need to assess the digital maturity of your service and workflows and make an individual improvement plan that aligns with your local authority’s overarching vision and goals.

You can find more guidance on [Commissioning digital products or services](https://www.digitalbuyingguide.org/en/guide/) and sign up to the [Local Digital Declaration](https://www.localdigital.gov.uk/declaration/).

You should understand how your service has developed over time, your existing infrastructure and have a clear vision of what you want your service to achieve before seeking any solution or development.

There is also government guidance on [developing a roadmap guidance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/developing-a-roadmap).
