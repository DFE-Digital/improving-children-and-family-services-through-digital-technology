title: Improving children and family services through digital technology
---

##Introduction

This guidance is to help local authorities consider how they can develop the digital systems they use to manage their childrens social care services. These systems often interact and support wider children and family services, therefore this guidance may also apply more widely. 

It considers how systems can:

* support the recording, tracking and analysis of children’s and families’ records 
* how the systems are procured, set up and managed
* how they interact with other systems to share information and link services together
* how they can be monitored and measured to identify opportunities for improvement

Systems need to meet a number of complex needs that can potentially conflict, such as:

* meeting the needs of people who use the system (based on research with them)
* efficiency, quality and value for money
* monitoring the service and performance reporting
* meeting legal duties to report and share information

Whilst digital technology and the use of digital systems can create efficiencies and better oversight, they can only work well when developed with and embedded into best practice and support frontline delivery of children's social care.
