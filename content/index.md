title: Digital standards for children's social care
---

The Department for Education has worked with local authorities and suppliers to identify opportunities to improve case management systems to better support children’s social care for to improve the lives of children and families. 

We have developed a set of design principles and wish to build on these by working with the sector to offer further support and guidance for local authorities and system suppliers. 

Use this guidance alongside existing technical standards, as indicated, to plan, procure, implement and make improvements to existing children's social care case management systems.

## Reasons for setting key principles

Case management systems need to:

* meet user needs, based on research with users
* support the sharing of information across agencies e.g. health and police 
* be easy to maintain
* be scalable for future use
* allow for intergration with third-party suppliers
* provide value for money

The resources section gives links to existing guidance on digital, data and technology standards that we refer to throughout these principles. 

## Key principles

1. [Design systems in a user-centred way to meet user needs](/principle-1)
2. [Design systems to work interoperably](/principle-2)
3. [Design systems that are simple to use](/principle-3)
4. [Design systems to be accessible and inclusive](/principle-4)
5. [Design systems that reflect the voice of the child](/principle-5)
6. [Design systems that include performance analytics for monitoring](principle-6)
7. [Design systems that secure personal data without inhibiting children’s social care practice](principle-7)
