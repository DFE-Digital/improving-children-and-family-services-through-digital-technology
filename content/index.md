title: Improving children and family services through digital technology
---

This guidance is to help local authorities consider how they can develop their digital systems to improve their children and family services. 

It considers how systems can:

* support the recording, tracking and analysis of children’s and families’ records 
* how the systems are procured, set up and managed
* how they interact with other systems to share information and link services together
* how they can be monitored and measured to identify improvements opportunities

Systems need to meet a number of complex needs that can potentially conflict, such as:

* meeting the needs of people who use the system (based on research with them)
* supporting the sharing of information across agencies, for example health and police
* be easy to maintain
* be adaptable for future use
* allowing for integration with third-party systems
* efficiency, quality and value for money
* monitoring the service and performance reporting
* meeting legal duties to report and share information

Whilst digital technology and the use of digital systems can create efficiencies and better oversight, they can only work well when developed with and embedded into best practice.
