##Importance of securing personal data

Local authorities have a legal duty to protect the information they record, hold and share about vulnerable children. Failing in this duty would undermine public trust in local government services.

Local authorities and suppliers should:

* identify security and privacy threats to the service, have a robust approach to securing information and manage fraud risks
* have a plan and budget to manage security for the service (for example by responding to new threats, putting controls in place and applying security patches to software)
* collect and process children and families’ personal information in a way that’s secure and respects their privacy
* use an approach to identity assurance and authentication, for services that need them, that balances the risks in a proportionate way 
* work with business and information risk teams (for example, senior information risk owners (SIROs), information asset owners (IAOs) and data guardians) to make sure the service meets security requirements without putting delivery at risk
* carry out appropriate vulnerability and penetration testing

##Data standards

1. Handling personal data - Staff ensure that personal data is handled, stored and shared securely and lawfully. 
2. Being accountable and responsible for personal data - Staff understand that they must handle information responsibly and are accountable for deliberate or avoidable breaches.
3. Regular data security training - All staff complete annual data security training and must pass a mandatory test. Local authorities must support their staff in understanding data security.
4. Access to child, family and social worker personal data - Personal data can only be accessed by staff who need it, and access is removed when it is no longer required.
5. Improvement of processes - Processes are reviewed at least once a year to identify and improve processes that may have caused data breaches. 
6. Handling cyber attacks - Cyber attacks against services are identified and prevented. CareCERT security advice is responded to.
7. Data security planning - A plan is in place to respond to threats to data security, including data breaches or near misses, tested once a year. 
8. Operating systems are approved and certified - No unsupported operating systems, software or internet browsers are used within the IT estate.
9. Cyber security planning - A plan is in place for protecting IT systems from cyber threats. This should be based on a proven cyber security framework, reviewed once a year.
10. IT suppliers are accountable for protecting personal data- IT suppliers are held accountable for protecting the personal data they hold.

The detailed guidance for these standards is available through the [NHS Data Security and Protection Toolkit](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/our-work/nhs-digital-data-and-technology-standards/framework/beta---data-security-standards).

##Good practice

During procurement, the following should be demonstrated:

* how the system meets the required standards 
* how it complies with [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/)
* a clear understanding of what data can be accessed and shared across organisations
* how it allows management to deny or permit access without needing assistance from support teams
* how it handles alerts when access is attempted without permission

##Challenges

This needs to link to the overall security of systems (for example, where it is hosted). Practice should drive the system, not the other way around. Most data breaches are down to human error so the system need to have control measures in place to minimise this risk.
