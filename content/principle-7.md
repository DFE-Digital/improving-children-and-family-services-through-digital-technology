title: "Monitoring, measuring and continuous improvement"

Suppliers and developers should set out the measures that will be used to assess outcomes and set key performance indicators (KPIs). Performance data must be available to monitor and improve the service. This information should be assessed against the KPIs to inform iterations. 

In addition, suppliers should show how efficient their case management system is. For this purpose, they should demonstrate:

* children’s social care expertise has been involved in the design, testing and sign-off of the product (including from social workers)
* the functions available in the system
* there is a plan to ensure the system remains up to date
* how they will monitor the system to identify issues and gather feedback
* how they will risk assess and prioritise iterations to ensure the system continues to meet user needs throughout the contract
* how the system ensures data security and adheres  to  data protection regulations

Local authorities should involve children and young people directly in the design of their services and systems. Use assessment criteria that  includes outcome and impact measures created from the child’s or young person’s perspective.

You can support this by:

* training staff in co-design to involve children and young people in the process
* evaluation and selection processes which are designed and funded to properly involve children and young people

## Using data

Data should be used to inform decision-making at all levels, from frontline workers, to strategic planners, and across the safeguarding partnership. It can be used more effectively by improving technology, infrastructure, and processes. 

Systems should collect data that:

* meets statutory guidance
* monitors performance
* is accessible to users

Local authorities need to understand the data they collect and rationalise what they collect and why on a regular basis. They should make themselves aware of data requirements and limitations of their systems before identifying new systems, upgrades or developments. 

Performance data and analytics should be made available to improve policy development and transparency. 

Information should be made available for decision-making as close to real-time as possible.

Suppliers and developers should demonstrate:

* how the system provides appropriate controlled access to the data through reports and data warehouse
* how it  runs reports directly from the system
* how it  connects to data a warehouse and be used with other products, such as data mapping and visualisation tools 
* that the reporting tool is not process intensive
