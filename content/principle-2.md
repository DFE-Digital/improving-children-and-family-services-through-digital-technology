title: "Design systems to work interoperably"

##Systems need to talk to each other

Safeguarding and supporting vulnerable children requires a number of organisations to work together. Often information needs to be shared between local authorities and other partners such as the police, health services and schools or colleges.

Sharing information between organisations is disrupted if the systems holding the information are not connected and this can pose safeguarding risks. 

Interoperability is needed to ensure systems within local authorities can be joined-up to enable the smooth and secure flow of information. It also means local authorities can integrate their systems with applications from a range of suppliers to best meet their service needs.

##Benefits of interoperability

Interoperability allows the exchange and sharing of information between different systems. 

These systems need to be joined up and allow communication across regions and organisations. Systems should enable quick and efficient sharing of children and family data. Case management systems should also allow for the intergration of third party applications.

Applications, data and processes must work together to make the right information available to the right user at the right time. The systems underpinning this must also be affordable and sustainable. 

##Use open application programming interfaces (APIs)

Having key functionality available through an API ensures organisations can integrate systems and deliver the best systems to suit their needs. 

Some local authorities may already have systems providing ‘end to end’ functionality that do not require additional integration work. This is an acceptable approach, however it limits can limit options and flexibility moving forward. Ensuring systems have open API’s means you have flexibility and control, both technically and commercially.

Sharing data within different systems helps to promote and support innovation. With appropriate controls in place, it’s easier for social care workers to use this information to improve child safety. It also allows for the creation of add-on products and services to be purchased and intergrated without being tied to a the provider of the primary system. This can often be done quicker and at lower cost.

* [Describing RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-open-standards-for-government/describing-restful-apis-with-openapi-3)
* [Data security standards - Standard 7](https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Help/Attachment/486), part of the [Data Security Standards](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/our-work/nhs-digital-data-and-technology-standards/framework/beta---data-security-standards)

##Good practice

During procurement, the following should be demonstrated:

* how the product can link with early help, virtual school, education, health systems and other existing systems 
* how the product can link with future systems local authorities might adopt
* how the product meets the open API standards
* examples of collaboration or integration
* the transfer of information between systems

##Challenges

Providers may not be inclined to make it easy to develop interoperability with Local Authority developed applications or third party products. Local authorities may also experience challenges making older systems connect with newer ones.
