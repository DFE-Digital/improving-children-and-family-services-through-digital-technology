title: "Design systems to work interoperably"

##Systems need to talk to each other

Safeguarding and supporting vulnerable children requires a number of organisations to work together. Information needs to be shared between local authorities and other partners such as the police, health services and schools or colleges.

Sharing information between organisations is disrupted if the systems holding the information are not connected. This can pose safeguarding risks. 

Interoperability is needed to ensure systems within local authorities can be joined-up to enable the smooth and secure flow of information. It also means local authorities can integrate their systems with applications from a range of suppliers to best meet their service needs.

##Benefits of interoperability

Applications, data and processes must work together to make the right information available to the right user at the right time.

Interoperability supports:

* the exchange and sharing of information between different systems to allow communication across local authorities and other organisations
* quick, efficient, appropriate and safe sharing of child and family data
* the integration of third party applications.   

##Use open application programming interfaces (APIs)

Application programming interfaces (APIs) allows two applications to communicate with one another to access data.

Having key functionality available through an API ensures organisations can integrate systems and deliver the best systems to suit their needs. 

Some local authorities may already have systems providing ‘end to end’ functionality that do not require additional integration work. This is an acceptable approach, however it can limit options and flexibility moving forward. Ensuring systems have open APIs means you have flexibility and control, both technically and commercially.

Sharing data within different systems helps to promote and support innovation. With appropriate controls in place, it’s easier for social care workers to use this information to improve child safety and wellbeing. It also allows for add-on products and services to be purchased and intergrated with third party supplier products. APIs often allow this to be done quicker and at a lower cost than other methods.

##Guidance

* [Open standards for government data and technology](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/open-standards-for-government-data-and-technology#recommended-open-standards)
* [Describing RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/recommended-open-standards-for-government/describing-restful-apis-with-openapi-3)
* [Data security standards - Standard 7](https://www.dsptoolkit.nhs.uk/Help/Attachment/486), part of the [Data Security Standards](https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/our-work/nhs-digital-data-and-technology-standards/framework/beta---data-security-standards)

##Good practice

During procurement, the following should be demonstrated:

* how the product can link with early help, virtual school, education, health systems and other existing systems, including across mulit-agency partnerships 
* how the product can link with future systems local authorities might adopt
* how the product meets open API standards
* examples of collaboration or integration
* the appropriate, secure and transfer of information between systems

##Challenges

Local authorities may also experience challenges making older systems connect with newer ones.
