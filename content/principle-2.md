title: "User needs"
---

When reviewing the need for a new system, upgrade or application you should consider the needs of different users within the service, local authority and wider community. You should make sure you have a clearly identified all those who use the system or it's outputs. 

Suppliers and developers should demonstrate how:

* the design and implementation will be tested and iterated to ensure it continues to meet user needs
* social worker and other service user input has been used to design the system
* user needs have been balanced with business and technical requirements of the system
* the system provides easy access to information and supports users to accurately capture quality data
* the systems or development will support the service's vision and goals and be outcomes based

Systems, updates and development should be tested with users during an iterative design process ahead of implementation. 

The focus of the system should be enabling the user to identify the record and support the needs of the child and family.

It is useful to frame user needs as problems to be solved and then do a seperate exercise to map how potential options could resolve those problems. Speak with your suppliers and developers about potential solutions. 

## Conduct user research

Children’s social care systems should be developed in response to the changing needs of users and service developments. A user is anyone who uses the system directly or uses outputs from the system. 

You should think about who your users are and speak to them to understand what they need from the system, for example: 

* social workers
* service delivery managers
* data analysts
* children and families
* business partners
* multi-agency partnerships
 
Consider how a system will complement:

* the experience of social workers, children and families
* the skills and abilities of the different users of the system
* how the outputs will be used, for example, reporting to the Department for Education (DfE) or preparing for an Ofsted inspection
* the interaction with other systems, such as adult social, health and education systems
* the ability to make improvements to social care services by using data from the system to spot trends, gaps and make predictions

You should regularly work with developers and suppliers to assess the design and performance of case management systems against user needs, and ensure the assessments inform future iterations. You should have an understanding of any barriers that may impact on a users ability to make the most of a system, such as training or time to change their way of working. 

You should learn about the problems users face by:

* building prototypes or test environments to test hypotheses and functionality in ‘live’ practice
* using analytics and other available data to better understand the problem
* using methods such as surveys, group workshops and feedback loops to support their understanding

You should consider how you will continue to gather insights and feedback from users of the system to ensure any new needs are identified and met. You should look to share insights and system performance analytics on a regular basis to inform system developments.
