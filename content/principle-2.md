title: "Be clear on where you want to be"

Digital systems and tools should support your children’s social care service to deliver its vision and goals more effectively and efficiently.  

Systems, whether purchased or developed in-house, need to be designed, implemented and managed based on the needs of your individual local authority, its partners and  your users. . 

Take into consideration how the digital system will:

* help frontline users to meet the needs of children and families
* take account of users’ individual needs, including  different locations, digital skills and accessibility requirements.
* help empower children and families 
* support joined-up multi-agency family and safeguarding services
* provide data for decision-making, planning and oversight at all levels of the system, without data collection getting in the way of frontline delivery 
* comply with information sharing and data requirements 
* be compatible with existing processes, data, systems, technology and tools
* be deliverable within budget and resource planning limits
* be flexible in response to changing needs and requirements 

This is not an exhaustive list. You should understand how your service has developed over time, your existing infrastructure and have a clear vision of what you want your service to achieve before seeking any solution or development.
