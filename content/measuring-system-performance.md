title: "Measuring the performance of digital systems"
---

Suppliers and developers should work with you to set out the measures that will be used to assess outcomes and set key performance indicators (KPIs). Performance data must be available to monitor and improve the service. This information should be assessed against the KPIs to inform iterations.

You should ensure suppliers also show the efficiency of their case management system. For this purpose, they should demonstrate:

* that children’s social care expertise has been involved in the design, testing and sign-off of the product (including from social workers)
* the functions available in the system
* there is a plan to ensure the system remains up to date
* how they will minimise data entry for users and risks of data entry errors
* how they will monitor the system to identify issues and gather feedback
how they will risk assess and prioritise iterations to ensure the system continues to meet user needs throughout the contract
* how the system ensures data security and adheres to data protection regulations

Local authorities should involve children and young people directly in the design of their services and systems. Use assessment criteria that includes outcome and impact measures created from the child’s or young person’s perspective.

You can support this by:

* designing systems collaboratively with users and involving children and young people in the process
* using evaluation and selection processes which are designed and funded to properly involve children and young people

Local authorities should consider how they will measure performance of the system and manage necessary updates through the life of their contract with a supplier. Guidance is available on Contract management standards.

### Using data

Data should be used to inform decision-making at all levels, from frontline workers to strategic planners, and across the safeguarding partnership. It can be used more effectively by improving technology, infrastructure, and processes.

Systems should collect data that:

* meets statutory guidance, in terms of collecting, sharing and reporting
* monitors performance
* is accessible to users

Local authorities need to understand the data that they collect, rationalise the data that they collect and be able to explain why they collect it on a regular basis. They should make themselves aware of data requirements and limitations of their systems before identifying new systems, upgrades or developments.

Make sure that suppliers and developers demonstrate:

* how the system provides appropriate controlled access to the data and the ability to generate reports
* how it runs reports directly from the system
* how it connects to data a warehouse and be used with other products, such as data mapping and visualisation tools
* that the reporting tool is not process intensive
* how changes in data requirements could be managed through the life of the contract

Information should be made available for decision-making as close to real-time as possible.
