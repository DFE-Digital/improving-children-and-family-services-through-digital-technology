To make the best use of digital systems and technology, you need to:

* identify the services vision and goals
* carry out an assessment of how existing systems are used
* identify barriers and ways digital services can be developed 
* understand how users interact with existing systems 
* make a problem statement that details your desired outcomes

You should also do an assessment of your digital maturity and make an individual improvement plan that aligns with  your  local authorities' overarching vision and goals. 

There are different ways you can carry out a digital maturity assessment.
