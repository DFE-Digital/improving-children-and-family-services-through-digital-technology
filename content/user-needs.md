title: "User needs"
---

When reviewing the need for a new system, upgrade or application you should consider the needs of different users within the service, local authority and wider community. You should make sure you have a clearly identified all those who use the system or it's outputs. 

Suppliers and developers should demonstrate how:

* the design and implementation will be tested and iterated to ensure it continues to meet user needs
* social worker and other service user input has been used to design the system
* user needs have been balanced with business and technical requirements of the system
* the system provides easy access to information and supports users to accurately capture quality data
* the systems or development will support the service's vision and goals and be outcomes based

Systems, updates and development should be tested with users during an iterative design process ahead of implementation. 

The focus of the system should be enabling the user to identify the record and support the needs of the child and family.

It is useful to frame user needs as problems to be solved and then do a seperate exercise to map how potential options could resolve those problems. Speak with your suppliers and developers about potential solutions. 

## Conduct user research

Children’s social care systems should be developed in response to the changing needs of users and service developments. A user is anyone who uses the system directly or uses outputs from the system. 

You should think about who your users are and speak to them to understand what they need from the system, for example: 

* social workers
* service delivery managers
* data analysts
* children and families
* business partners
* multi-agency partnerships
 
Consider how a system will complement:

* the experience of social workers, children and families
* the skills and abilities of the different users of the system
* how the outputs will be used, for example, reporting to the Department for Education (DfE) or preparing for an Ofsted inspection
* the interaction with other systems, such as adult social, health and education systems
* the ability to make improvements to social care services by using data from the system to spot trends, gaps and make predictions

You should regularly work with developers and suppliers to assess the design and performance of case management systems against user needs, and ensure the assessments inform future iterations. You should have an understanding of any barriers that may impact on a users ability to make the most of a system, such as training or time to change their way of working. 

You should learn about the problems users face by:

* building prototypes or test environments to test hypotheses and functionality in ‘live’ practice
* using analytics and other available data to better understand the problem
* using methods such as surveys, group workshops and feedback loops to support their understanding

You should consider how you will continue to gather insights and feedback from users of the system to ensure any new needs are identified and met. You should look to share insights and system performance analytics on a regular basis to inform system developments.

Systems and tools must be accessible to meet the needs of a diverse range of users. This should take into account their locations and different needs, such as physical, cultural or learning needs.

They must:

* be easy to use and understand
* meet accessibility standards for both online and offline elements
* not exclude any users they are intended to serve

## Accessibility needs

Local authorities have a legal duty to meet web content accessibility standards.

Suppliers and local authorities should:

* do research with potential users for the service with a range of accessibility needs
* make sure people are not excluded from using the system
* deliver appropriate training and support where necessary
* gather evidence of user feedback on the accessibility and inclusivity of systems
* release updates to continually improve the accessibility of the system

Local authorities should have an understanding of the access needs of their staff and have mechanisms in place to develop solutions with these users. This could be through a reference groups, for example.

Suppliers and developers should demonstrate how the system:

* works across different devices and is browser based
* supports offline working
* meets accessibility standards
* works with assistive technology

Local authorities must comply with the [Equality Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents).

## Understanding system options

You should explore what options are available. Speak to other local authorities who have implemented new systems or developed their system. 

Identify what is suitable for your circumstances and will allow for future growth and development. 

You should consider:

* whether the system will give you a suitable foundation that you can build upon
* if users can use the system in an optimised way
* if extra support is needed 
* whether there are complexities that might be an  issue for users
* if you can take on another system or  have plans in place to make things simpler
* whether you’ve got resources to make things simpler
* how you can optimise what you already have
* how to ensure no loss of knowledge when staff leave

You should think about how the wider context, such as behavioural or cultural factors, will support or potentially detract from delivering a system that meets user and service needs. 

For example:

* cultural barriers to information sharing
* lack of workforce confidence in using new digital technology

Speak to other local authorities who have implemented new systems or developed their system, this could be done as part of a pre-market engagement exercise or something which you you look to do ahead of developing an existing system.
