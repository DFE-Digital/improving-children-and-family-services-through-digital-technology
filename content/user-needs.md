title: Assessing needs and requirements
---

You should consider how the system will help frontline users to meet the needs of children and families. You should take account of users’ individual needs  including different locations, digital skills and accessibility requirements.

A user is anyone who uses the system directly or uses information from the system.

You should think about who your users are and speak to them to understand what they need from the system. Your users might include:

* social workers
* service delivery managers
* data analysts
* children, families and carers
* business partners
* multi-agency partnerships

Consider how systems will complement:

* the experience of social workers, children and families
* the skills and abilities of the different users of the system
* how the outputs will be used, for example, reporting to the Department for Education (DfE) or preparing for an Ofsted inspection
* interaction with other systems, such as adult social, health and education systems
* the ability to make improvements to social care services by using data from the system to spot trends, gaps and make predictions

### Assess user needs

When reviewing the need for a new system, upgrade or development you should consider the needs of different users within the service, local authority and wider community. You should make sure you have clearly identified all those who use the system or its outputs.

You should make sure suppliers and developers demonstrate how:

* the design and implementation will be tested and iterated to ensure it continues to meet user needs
* input from social workers and other service users has been used to design the system
* user needs have been balanced with business and technical needs of the system
* the system provides easy access to information and supports users to accurately capture quality data
* the system or development will support the service’s vision and goals and be focused on specific outcomes

Systems, updates and development should be tested with users during an iterative design process ahead of implementation, meaning that the design should be improved and refined several times based on user feedback..

It is useful to frame user needs as problems to be solved and then do a seperate exercise to map how potential options could resolve those problems. Speak with your suppliers and developers about potential solutions.

The focus of the system should be to help the user to easily gather and input information to support the needs of the child and family.

### Conduct user research

Children’s social care systems should be developed in response to the changing needs of users and service developments. You should regularly work with developers and suppliers to assess the design and performance of case management systems against user needs, and ensure the assessments inform future versions. You should understand what might stop users from making the most of a system, such as training or time to change their way of working.

You should learn about the problems users face by:

* building prototypes or test environments to test hypotheses and functionality in ‘live’ practice
* using data analytics and other available data to better understand the problem
* using methods such as surveys, group workshops and feedback loops to support your understanding

You should consider how you will continue to gather insights and feedback from users of the system to ensure any new needs are identified and met. You should share insights and system performance analytics on a regular basis to inform system developments.

The Government Digital Services (GDS) have a [service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual), which contains guidance on [Learning about users and their needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs) and [Conducting user research in the discovery phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/user-research-in-discovery). 

### Accessibility

Systems and tools must be accessible to meet the needs of a diverse range of users. This should take into account the users’ location and different needs, such as physical, cultural or learning needs.

They must:

* be easy to use and understand
* meet accessibility standards for both online and offline elements
* not exclude any users they are intended to serve

Local authorities have a legal duty to meet [web content accessibility standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). There is also [guidance available on accessibility requirements for public sector websites and apps](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps).

Suppliers and local authorities should:

* do research with potential users of the service with a range of accessibility needs, including visual, physical and other needs
* make sure people are not excluded from using the system
* deliver appropriate training and support where necessary
* gather evidence of user feedback on the accessibility and inclusivity of systems
* release updates to continually improve the accessibility of the system

Local authorities should have an understanding of the accessibility needs of their staff and have mechanisms in place to develop solutions with these users. This could be through a panel or a group of representative users, for example.

The Government Digital Services (GDS) have a [service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual), which contains guidance on [Testing with assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies) and [Making your service accessible: an introduction](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction).

There is also government guidance on [Understanding accessibility requirements for public sector bodies](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps).

You should make sure suppliers and developers have demonstrated how the system:

* works across different devices and is browser-based
* supports offline working
* meets accessibility standards
* works with assistive technology

Local authorities must comply with the [Equality Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents) and may want to seek legal advice on how to meet this.

## Understanding system options

You should explore what options are available and identify what is suitable for your circumstances and will allow for future growth and development.

You should consider:

* whether the system will give you a suitable foundation that you can build upon
* if users can use the system in a way that meets their needs and if extra support is needed
* whether it is easy to use
* how you can optimise what you already have
* how to ensure no loss of knowledge when staff leave

You should think about how the wider context, such as behavioural or cultural factors, will support or potentially detract from delivering a system that meets user and service needs.

For example:

* cultural barriers to information sharing
* lack of workforce confidence in using new digital technology

This could be done as part of a pre-market engagement exercise or something you do ahead of developing an existing system. 

There is government guidance on [Talking to suppliers before you buy guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/talking-to-suppliers-before-you-buy-digital-marketplace-services) and guidance from Crown Commercial Services on [Conducting pre-tender market engagemen](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/news/conducting-pre-tender-market-engagement-virtually).
